  <h2>Why are bears so awesome?!? Just because.</h2>
  <hr/> At this point, I think we can all agree that bears are just the best. Here are some bear thoughts from: <a href=https://helloiamabear.com/>https://helloiamabear.com</a>

  <h3>Bear Thoughts</h3> Since I have no way to determine if I am good at being a bear, I really have no way to determine if I should have progressed in my bearness. I have never gotten any kind of clue or indication that I should be getting better at being a bear over some
  period of time. Should I be a better bear each day? Each year? Is my progress meant to be incremental or something that should be obvious and very easily noticeable?
  <br></br>
  Or, maybe, I am not supposed to become a better bear. There is a chance that my bearness is not meant to grow. Maybe I am a bear, and I am supposed to be just the bear I am. Not a better one. Not a worse one. Just one, single bear that I already am until
  I am not a bear anymore.
